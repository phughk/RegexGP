# RegexGP
Regular Expression Genetic Programming Solver

The goal of this program is to create Regular Expressions (RE) through a Genetic Programming method.
Users should be able to specify {URL : TARGET_TEXT} pairs for both training and test data.

The fitness should be 100 for a regex that matches only TARGET_TEXT over all training cases.

Final regex fitness can be evaluated with test cases.
